    <h1>Platformer Game</h1>
    <h2 style="color:orange">WARNING - THIS GUIDE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, IT IS NOT YET COMPLETE</h2>
    <p>
        This guide will walk you through how to create a simple platformer game with Wolfie2D,
        and will introduce several features of the game engine.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is assumed that at this point, you have a project file properly installed which you are able to serve
        with Web Server for Chrome. If not, follow the <a href="/#guides/setup">guide on setup</a>.
    </p>
    <h3><code>main.ts</code> - Your entry point into the application</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The code for every Wolfie2D project starts with the <code>main.ts</code> file in <code>src/</code>
        directory of the project. Here, you will create your game instance, start the game, and add a scene to display.
        By default, Wolfie2D displays the scene defined by <code>default_scene.ts</code>.
        The code in <code>main.ts</code> is as follows:
    </p>
    
    <div class="code-block">
    <div class="header">main.ts</div>
    <pre class="code-body"><code>
    import Game from "./Wolfie2D/Loop/Game";
    import default_scene from "./default_scene";
    
    <span class="code-comment">// The main function is your entrypoint into Wolfie2D. Specify your first scene and any options here.</span>
    (function main(){
        <span class="code-comment">// These are options for initializing the game</span>
        <span class="code-comment">// Here, we'll simply set the size of the viewport, and make the background of the game black</span>
        let options = {
            viewportSize: {x: 800, y: 600},
            clearColor: {r: 0, g: 0, b: 0},
        }
    
        <span class="code-comment">// Create our game. This will create all of the systems.</span>
        const demoGame = new Game(options);
    
        <span class="code-comment">// Run our game. This will start the game loop and get the updates and renders running.</span>
        demoGame.start();
    
        <span class="code-comment">// For now, we won't specify any scene options.</span>
        let sceneOptions = {};
    
        <span class="code-comment">// Add our first scene. This will load this scene into the game world.</span>
        demoGame.getSceneManager().addScene(default_scene, sceneOptions);
    })();
    </code></pre></div>
    <p>
        There isn't too much going on here. First, we create a <a href="#docs/GameLoop/Game">Game</a> object with
        the options we specify, then we start the game. Last, we get the SceneManager and add the default_scene constructor
        that we imported. For a most games, this is all that will be in the <code>main.ts</code> file -
        the only thing you may really need to change is the Scene constructor and the options given to the game and
        the scene.
    </p>
    <h3>A Custom Scene</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Instead of using the default project, let's create our own scene. In the <code>src/</code>
        directory, create a new file called <code>Platformer.ts</code>.
        Inside of that file, export a new class that extends Scene:
    </p>
    <div class="code-block">
    <div class="header">Platformer.ts</div>
    <pre class="code-body"><code>
    import Scene from "./Wolfie2d/Scene/Scene";

    export default class Platformer extends Scene {

    }
    </code>
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
        Then replace that as the Scene loaded in <code>main.ts</code>:
    </p>
    <div class="code-block">
    <div class="header">main.ts</div>
    <pre class="code-body"><code>
        ...
        import Platformer from "./Platformer";
    
        (function main(){
            <span class="code-comment">// Our sprites are small, so specify a zoom level of 4. Also change the clear color and set up key bindings</span>
            let options = {
                canvasSize: {x: 800, y: 600},
                zoomLevel: 4,
                clearColor: {r: 34, g: 32, b: 52},
                inputs: [
                    { name: "left", keys: ["a"] },
                    { name: "right", keys: ["d"] },
                    { name: "jump", keys: ["space", "w"]}
                ]
            }
           ...        
            <span class="code-comment">// We still don't need to specify scene options.</span>
            let sceneOptions = {};
        
            <span class="code-comment">// Add our own scene as the initial scene.</span>
            demoGame.getSceneManager().addScene(Platformer, sceneOptions);
        })();
    </code>
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
        Currently, our new scene doesn't do anything exciting, or any thing at all. Let's change that.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Scene has 3 primary methods for controlling its behavior: <code>loadScene()</code>, <code>startScene()</code>, and <code>updateScene()</code>.
        They behave as they sound like they should - <code>loadScene()</code> allows you to load assets for use by the Scene,
        <code>startScene()</code> does all behaviors when the Scene starts, after loading, but before any update occur,
        and <code>updateScene()</code> allows you to control the behavior of the Scene and any GameNodes in the Scene
        on a frame-to-frame basis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's start with <code>loadScene()</code> and bring in a sprite to use as our player character.
        There are some assets included in Wolfie2D already, which are in the <code>dist/demo_assets/</code> folder.
        For this project, let's take the animated player sprite from <code>demo_assets/spritesheets/platformer/player.json</code>.
        We'll also have to give the load method a key for the sprite, so we can reference it later - let's make that simply <code>player</code>.
        If we put this into the <code>loadScene()</code> method, we get:
    </p>
    <div class="code-block">
    <div class="header">Platformer.ts</div>
    <pre class="code-body"><code>
    loadScene(){
        this.load.spritesheet("player", "demo_assets/spriteheets/platformer/player.json");
    }
    </code>
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
        Notice that we reference the <code>player.json</code> file, and not the corresponding spritesheet.
        This is because the format of the json file contains information about the associated image.
        If you want to see the gritty details of the json file, follow the path in your text editor and check it out.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, we can add the player to the scene. To do this, we can use the key we created to make an AnimatedSprite
        object in the <code>startScene()</code> method:
    </p>
    <div class="code-block">
    <div class="header">Platformer.ts</div>
    <pre class="code-body"><code>
    private player: AnimatedSprite;
    ...
    startScene(){
        <span class="code-comment">// We need to add a layer for the player to go on. We'll give it a depth of 1</span>
        this.addLayer("primary", 1);

        this.player = this.add.animatedSprite("player", "primary");
        this.player.animation.play("IDLE");
        this.player.postion.set(this.viewport.getCenter().x, this.viewport.getCenter().y);
    }
    </code>
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
        Now, if we serve our application and look at the browser,
        we see a static version of our player in the center of the screen:
    </p>
    <img src="images/platformer_player_img.png" alt="The player in the middle of the screen">
    <p>
        Great! But this isn't much of a game. Let's load and add some more assets and make our game world a little more filled out.
    </p>
    <div class="code-block">
    <div class="header">Platformer.ts</div>
    <pre class="code-body"><code>
    private player: AnimatedSprite;
    ...
    loadScene(){
        <span class="code-comment">// Load the player spritesheet</span>
        this.load.spritesheet("player", "demo_assets/spritesheets/platformer/player.json");

        <span class="code-comment">// Load the tilemap</span>
        this.load.tilemap("platformer", "demo_assets/tilemaps/platformer/platformer.json");

        <span class="code-comment">// Load the background image</span>
        this.load.image("background", "demo_assets/images/platformer_background.png");

        <span class="code-comment">// Load a jump sound</span>
        this.load.audio("jump", "demo_assets/sounds/jump.wav");
    }
    ...
    startScene(){
        this.addLayer("primary", 1);

        <span class="code-comment">// Add the player in the starting position</span>
        this.player = this.add.animatedSprite("player", "primary");
        this.player.animation.play("IDLE");
        this.player.position.set(3*16, 18*16);

        <span class="code-comment">// Size of the tilemap is 64x20. Tile size is 16x16</span>
        this.viewport.setBounds(0, 0, 64*16, 20*16);
        this.viewport.follow(this.player);

        <span class="code-comment">// Add the tilemap. Top left corner is (0, 0) by default</span>
        this.add.tilemap("platformer");

        <span class="code-comment">// Add a background to the scene</span>
        this.addParallaxLayer("bg", new Vec2(0.5, 1), -1);
        let bg = this.add.sprite("background", "bg");
        bg.position.set(bg.size.x/2, bg.size.y/2);
    }
    </code>
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
        Now the world looks a little better. From the starting position,
        you can see some of the background and some of the tilemap.

    <img src="images/platformer_more_assets_img.png" alt="More assets">
    <p>
        But in order to see the whole world,
        our player is going to need to move around. We'll do that by making a basic AI class:
    </p>
    <div class="code-block">
    <div class="header">PlatformerPlayerController.ts</div>
    <pre class="code-body"><code>
    export default class PlayerController implements AI {

        protected jumpSoundKey: string;
        protected emitter: Emitter;
    
        initializeAI(owner: AnimatedSprite, options: Record&lt;string, any&gt;): void {
            this.owner = owner;
            this.jumpSoundKey = options.jumpSoundKey;
            this.emitter = new Emitter();

                velocity.y += 10*deltaT;
            }
    
            if(this.owner.onGround && !Input.isJustPressed("jump")){
                <span class="code-comment">// If we're on the ground, but aren't jumping, show walk animation</span>
                if(velocity.x === 0){
                        this.owner.animation.playIfNotAlready("IDLE", true);
                } else {
                    this.owner.animation.playIfNotAlready("WALK", true);

            this.owner.invertX = velocity.x &lt; 0;
            
            this.owner.move(velocity);
        }
    }
    </code>
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
        There's a lot going on here. But let's break it down.
        First of all, by default, an AI receives its owner and some options through its initialization.
        We make sure to typecast to an AnimatedSprite here so we can use animations.
        We also make sure to create an emitter, since this will allow us to communicate with the audio manager later on.
    </p>
    <p>
        For our update, we take the player input information and turn it into a Vec2 for easy manipulation.
        Much of the movement code we're using here ties into the Physics system through the basic GameNode class.
        The first utility we use is <code>getLastVelocity()</code>, which simply does what it says,
        and retreives the velocity AFTER the last move. This is key here - if we collided with an object
        last frame, our velocity will be 0. The next physics related utility we use is <code>onGround</code>.
        This is a boolean created for your convenience. <code>onGround</code> just tells you whether or not the
        GameNode collided with anything on its bottom face last frame. Similarly, you also have access to
        <code>onCeiling</code> and <code>onWall</code>, which are not needed here. Lastly, to perform our
        movement through the physics system and assure that collisions are working, we call <code>move()</code>.
        It is worth noting that this method has no return, and does not immediately move the GameNode.
        It waits until the end of the update frame, and then handles movement for all moving nodes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other tricks used here are the animations, which simply reference the animation player from
        the AnimatedSprite class, and the sounds, for which we fire an event for the AudioManager.
    </p>
    <p>
        This player AI works fine, but ultimately is not very open to extension.
        If we add more abilities for the player like wall jumps (possible with <code>onWall</code>),
        or extra states like running where we need a different animation, we will struggle to keep
        clean, functional code. For situations like this, it may be better to implement a
        state machine, such as a Push Down Automata, or a Hierarchical State Machine,
        or even both at the same time! State machines are discussed in detail in the excellent eBook
        <a href="#resources">Game Programming Patterns</a>, a link to which can be found in the resources page of this site.
        Additionally, a PDA with potential for hierarchical states is implemeted in this game engine
        in the <a href="#docs/AI/StateMachineAI">StateMachineAI</a> class.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, in order to get this AI code to work with our game,
        all we need to do is assign it to the player, and activate physics for our player:
