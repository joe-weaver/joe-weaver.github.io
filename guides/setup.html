    <h1>Basic Setup</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to Wolfie2D!
        The purpose of this tutorial is to describe the setup of a new game using Wolfie2d.
        After following this, you should know how to get the technology up and running,
        and understand how to create a basic game.
    </p>
    <h3>Download and Installation</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Prior to beginning work on this game, it is recommended to download <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>
        or another similar text editor. Wolfie2D was developed with text editors in mind, and may not place nicely with an IDE like IntelliJ Idea.
        Additionally, you need to download Google Chrome and the add-on Web Server for Chrome.
        The files produced by Wolfie2D and the assets you include in your project will need to be served to the user,
        rather than just opened as flat files.
        Using Web Server for Chrome is highly recommended. Although you may be able to get python's http.server to work,
        we found it was buggy during the development of Wolfie2D, and did not always update promptly (presumably due to caching).
    </p>
    <p>
        Download the game engine from <a href="https://github.com/joe-weaver/GameEngine" target="_blank">https://github.com/joe-weaver/GameEngine</a>.
        git clone, or extract the contents to a new folder. This will be your project folder.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, navigate to the root directory of the project either through the terminal in VS Code (recommended), or through the git bash.
        Type <code>npm install</code>, and hit enter. This will install the necessary npm packages.
    </p>
    <p>
        These installed packages are all for the purpose of creating a TypeScript environment and allowing for
        the project to transpile after every save, speeding up the development experience. Check out
        <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/gulp.html" target="_blank">this tutorial from TypeScript</a>
        to see how the setup was done.
    </p>
    <p>At this point, you should have everything you need installed.</p>
    <h3>Project Structure and Transpilation</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Whenever you've updated your project's TypeScript code and want to view the changes to your game,
        you'll need to transpile your project. Thankfully, Gulp (a package installed via npm) handles that for us.
        Once Gulp is started, it will automatically transpile your code to a JavaScript file whenever you save your changes.
        It is worth noting that if you modify the <code>index.html</code> file, you will need to run Gulp again to see your changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        To run Gulp, simply type <code>gulp</code> into the terminal, and press enter.
        After this, Gulp, will be running, and any changes you make will automatically update the served application.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that this is complete, you file structure should look something like this:
    </p>
    <div class="code-block"><pre class="code-body"><code>
    [your-project-name]/
        │
        ├ dist/
        │   ├ assets/  <span class="code-comment">&lt;- This is where you will put any project assets</span>
        │   │   └ demo_assets/
        │   │       └... [default assets included for the demo projects] ...
        │   │
        │   ├ bundle.js    <span class="code-comment">&lt;- This is your transpiled code</span>
        │   └ index.html   <span class="code-comment">&lt;- This is your processed html file</span>
        │
        ├ node_modules/
        │   ├ ... [we don't care what's in here] ...
        │
        ├ src/
        │   ├ Wolfie2D/
        │   │   └ ... [In here is all of the game engine code]
        │   │
        │   ├ default_scene.ts
        │   ├ index.d.ts
        │   ├ index.html
        │   └ main.js      <span class="code-comment">&lt;- This is the entry point into the application</span>
        │
        ├ .gitignore
        ├ gulpfile.ts  <span class="code-comment">&lt;- This tells gulp how to package the project</span>
        ├ package-lock.json
        ├ package.json
        ├ readme.md
        └ tsconfig.json
    </code></pre></div>
    <p>
        When doing work on your game, you will create new code files in the <code>src</code> directory,
        and add any assets, like sprites or music, to the <code>dist/assets</code> directory.
    </p>
    <h3>Serving your Game</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Games created with Wolfie2D must be served to a browser to be properly seen.
        This can be done with a technology like Web Server for Chrome.
        To start the server, simply navigate to Web Server for Chrome, choose the <code>dist</code>
        folder of your project, then start the server. Now, if you navigate to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8887" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8887</a>,
        you should be able to see the view created in <code>default_scene.ts</code>:
    </p>
    <img src="images/default_scene_img.png" alt="The game created by default_scene.ts"/>
    <p>
        By default, you should be able to move around with WASD.
        You can look at the source code for this scene by viewing <code>default_scene.ts</code> in a text editor.
        If you make changes to this scene and save, Gulp will transpile the code. If you then refresh your browser,
        changes will automatically be reflected.
    </p>
    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
