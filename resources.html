            <h3><a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html">Game Programming Patterns</a></h3>
            <div>
                I can't say enough good things about this book. So many of its chapters are excellent
                resources for designing games or game engines, and all of it is written well and easy to understand.
                Of particular importance for the development of this game engine were the chapters on:
                <ol>
                    <li>Event Queues, which I followed for my own EventQueue</li>
                    <li>Component pattern, which I use everywhere, such as for event Receivers and Emitters, or for Tweens and Animations.</li>
                    <li>The State pattern, for state machines.</li>
                    <li>The Singleton pattern, for a select few classes of which there can only be one instance.</li>
                </ol>
                I highly recommend reading the entirety of this book, you'll thank yourself for it later.

            <h3><a href="https://noonat.github.io/intersect/">Intersection Tests in 2D</a></h3>
            <div>
                In my experience, desigining a working physics system is the hardest thing about making a game engine.
                Even before working on this, I struggled to get physics to work consistently and work well on small projects.
                This resource provides excellent examples of different intersection tests for 2D objects (AABBs, points and lines),
                and gave me an excellent reference for handling collisions. This, in combination with a bit of trial and error
                is what resulted in the current physics system of this game engine. If you want to extend PhysicsManager and make
                your own physics system, or you're simply trying to understand what is going on in my physics system, I highly recommend
                reading through this relatively short web page. It may also help to follow the code snippets and make a little demo on your own.

            <h3><a href="https://easings.net/">Easing Functions</a></h3>
            <div>
                I shamelessly copied the easing functions from this website for this game engine. Who has time to figure that stuff out for themselves?
                If you want a great visual representation of easing functions, check out this resource. I know I certainly always for get the difference between
                ease-in and ease-out. Additionally, if you want to make your own easing functions, you can look at the code on this page and
                get an idea of how to do so.

            <h3><a href="https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/">The Algorithm Design Manual</a></h3>
            <div>
                If you've taken CSE 373, you know how useful this book is. If you haven't taken it yet, you'll have to eventually,
                so you should just buy this book now - it's definitely worth every penny. I used this book for reference
                for many of the data structures I included in my game engine, such as Stacks, Queues, Graphs; and for many of 
                the associated algorithms, such as insertion sort and Djikstra's algorithm.

            <h3><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs">Typescript Docs</a></h3>
            <div>
                This entire game engine is written in Typescript (and any code you write will be in typescript).
                If you know Java or Javascript, learning Typescript shouldn't be too challenging, but having a resource
                for help is always good. I've found that the Typescript docs are fairly good at explaining confusing aspects
                of Typescript, and what they don't answer well or don't answer at all, Stack Overflow has an answer.
