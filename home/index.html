    <h1>Welcome to Wolfie2D!</h1>
    <p>Wolfie2D is a web-based game engine written in Typescript created by Joe Weaver and Richard McKenna.</p>
    <p>
        The goal of this website is to provide useful documentation, diagrams, and guides to help you
        start programming your game in Wolfie2D.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wolfie2D, and this documentation website, are still a work in progress, so there are always changes
        being made. It is very possible that some of the content of this website will not be up to date,
        but we're working on making sure everything reflects the current, rapidly changing state of the
        game engine.
    </p>
